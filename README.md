# solar_analyzer
WEB app for solar power installations.  
This app will load xls files from your energy company, analyze them and, based on your history, calculate which solar power installation makes more sense.  
It will show analysis between a WITH batteries and WITHOUT batteries installation and the SELL EXCESS to company option.   
This version only works with xls from "comercializadora regulada".  
Send me other companies csv or xls files and I will update it.
